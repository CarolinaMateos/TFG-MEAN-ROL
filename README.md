# Social Media Center for Online Roleplaying

Welcome to my first Angular project, which also served as my final degree project! This application is designed as a social media hub specifically tailored for online roleplaying enthusiasts.

## Project Overview

The platform allows users to create multiple profiles for different characters, facilitating rich interactions with other players. Users can engage in conversations, share experiences, and immerse themselves in a vibrant roleplaying community.

## Key Features

- **User Authentication:** Secure login and sign-up processes ensure that your personal information is protected.
- **Character Creation:** Users can create and manage multiple characters, each with its own unique profile.
- **Social Interaction:** Similar to platforms like X (formerly Twitter), users can post updates, share thoughts, and engage in discussions with others.
- **Messaging:** Open conversations with fellow players to collaborate and enhance your roleplaying experience.

Feel free to explore the code, contribute, or use this project as a foundation for your own ideas. I welcome feedback and suggestions!
